#MATLAB simulations
Some files of interest:
* coupledOsc: animating a raft on waves as a set of coupled oscillators
* elast: Calculate resulting velocities from a 2 body elastic collision
* FDTD: Simple 1-D FDTD test of a single interface between air and glass.
* gears: Contains files that produce a demonstration of the Antikythera mechanism
* genfield: Generate the speckle pattern produced by randomly phased coherent light passing through a circular aperture.
* gravity: Randomized animation of elastic balls being dropped into a box
* gyro: A functional gyroscope that works only by applying conservation of angular momentum
* runElast: Demonstrates how a series of elastic collisions using monotonically decreasing masses can yield high velocity motionas
